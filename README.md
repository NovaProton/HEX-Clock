The background colour of the webpage updates every second to match the hexadecimal value of the current time, making the whole display change colour over time. The time is also displayed in the centre of the page.

## Files
- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that includes the basic structure for the project.
- **style.css**: This file contains the styles used to centre the hexadecimal clock and make it visually appealing.
- **index.js**: This JavaScript file uses jQuery to dynamically update the background colour and the displayed time every second.
